# Experimenter actions
The experimenter may do two things during the experiment, both only possible in the 'attention grabbing phase' at the beginning of each trial:
* Press the 'p' key to pause the experiment (e.g. if participant/parent needs to go to the toilet). Unpause also done with 'p'.
* Press the 'a' key to play an attention grabbing sound.
